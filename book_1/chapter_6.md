Harry had to go back to the Dursleys for the next month and it was totes not chillax. Good thang was that Dudley was now so baka'ed by Harry that he social distanced from him like it was 2020 all over again, while his aunt and uncle ghosted him and pretended he didn't exist. It was cool for a bit, but soon it was a major bummer what with everyone acting like he was canceled.
Harry thankfully had his new owl to keep him vibin'. He decided to call her Hedwig cuz that was a cool sounding name he thought that he fished out of a book, which speaking of, were totes interesting which was unusual because they were school books, but whatevs. Channeling true angsty teen energy he stayed up late, but instead of Fortnite he simply read, and sometimes Hedwig would bring him a dead mouse, the furry kind.
On August 30 Harry realised that he had no way to haul his ass to Kings Cross. Normally talking to someone in person was hard enough, to say nothing of when it was Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, but it was that or walking which was gross, so he went downstairs to where the Dursleys had plopped their fat asses.
"Ahem-" said Harry.
"AAAAAAH." screamed Dudley, and bailed like someone had set his pants on fire.
Uncle Vernon grunted like a piggu.
"I needz ta go to Kings Cross tmr. Can I hitch a ride?"
Uncle Vernon grunted like a piggu again. "Dafuq you wizards be using a train? Yous carpets all got holes?"
"You ask me I ask tree."
"Well do you at least know where the school be at?"
"Tru dat, I'll check." Harry took the note from his pocket. "It just says I need to be at Platform 9 3/4 at eleven o clock."
