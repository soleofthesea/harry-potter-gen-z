Harry had to go back to the Dursleys for the next month and it was totes not chillax. Good thang was that Dudley was now so baka'ed by Harry that he social distanced from him like it was 2020 all over again, while his aunt and uncle ghosted him and pretended he didn't exist. It was cool for a bit, but soon it was a major bummer what with everyone acting like he was canceled.

Harry thankfully had his new owl to keep him vibin'. He decided to call her Hedwig cuz that was a cool sounding name he thought that he fished out of a book, which speaking of, were totes interesting which was unusual because they were school books, but whatevs. Channeling lofi energy he stayed up late, but instead of Fortnite he simply read, and sometimes Hedwig would bring him a dead mouse, the furry kind.

On August 30 Harry realised that he had no way to haul his ass to Kings Cross. Normally talking to someone in person was hard enough, to say nothing of when it was Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, but it was that or walking which was gross, so he went downstairs to where the Dursleys had plopped their asses.

"Ahem-" said Harry.

"AAAAAAH." screamed Dudley, and bailed from the room like a scrub exiting crypto.

Uncle Vernon grunted like a piggu.

"I finna be at Kings Cross tmr. Can I catch a ride?"

Uncle Vernon grunted like a piggu again. "I'm not an Uber, bozo. Dafuq you wizards be using a train anyway? Yous carpets all got holes?"

"You ask me I ask tree."

"Well ya boi at least know where the school be at?"

"Tru dat, I'll check." Harry took the note from his pocket. "It just says I need to be at Platform nine and three quarters at eleven o clock."

"What?"

"Platform nine and three quarters."

"Mouth breathers, they all are." Vernon said. "Only got one brain cell to share between all of them. But whateves, idgaf. Tmr I'm gotta be at London anyway, so thats why I'm even agreeing to this shizz."

"Why's you going to London?" asked Harry.

"Because we need to remove that phat pig tail from Dudley, you big dingus!"

The next day Harry got up at the asscrack of dawn because he was too hyped up to sleep. Howevs he didn't want to go too craycray yet so instead of putting on his robe and wizard hat he just put on your normal clothes. He paced for two hours until the others finally got out of slumberland, checked that he had everything and that Hedwig was safely in her cage, then hauled his big heavy suitcase into the Dursleys car, then the four of them set off careening to London and violating the ULEZ for good measure ðŸ˜Ž.

They reached King's Cross and Uncle Vernon hauled the suitcase onto a trolley. He even pushed it into the station for Harry, which Harry thought was kinda OOC but then Vernon stopped and emoted with a smug face.

"There's platform 9, and there's platform 10. You see platform 9 3/4 anywhere?"

Indeed it seemed platform 9 3/4 was channeling some major Bielefeld energy.

"Have fun." Vernon sksksk'ed, then all three of the Dursleys went and got a tan. Harry didn't know what to do. He tried to ask a guard but he thought he was trolling for not being able to answer where Hogwarts was and asking for a train that set off a non existent time. He stormed off, muttering about dumb Gen Z millenials.

"Ok boomer" said Harry. But he still had the problem that he did not know how to get on the train. He looked at his wrist and checked his digital watch, because the clock at Kings Cross was those old timey ones with the round face and the numbers in a circle and arrows pointing at them and he could not read it. He only had 10 minutes before the train yeeted!

At this moment though a woman with a bunch of kids walked by Harry and something she said caught his attention.

"Those Muggles I tell you, they are everywhere, you can't even walk two feet-"

One of the kids the woman was with piqued up.

"Mother, stop being so loud, the 'Muggles' can hear you."

"Oh relax Ginny, all of them are busy looking at their smarty-phones anyway. And if they do see us then we just Obliviate them so who cares?"

Harry shook his head. It seemed even with wizards boomers be boomerin'. He walked up to the woman and made himself known.

"Excuse me madam..."

"Hello dear. First year at Hogwarts?" said the woman. "Don't worry, my baby Ron is, too."

"Can you tell me how to get to platform 9 3/4?"

"Oh, it's very easy. You just bang your head against the wall, literally. And I really mean literally. Charge at the wall like you mean business."

"OK" said Harry.
