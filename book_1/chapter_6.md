Harry had to go back to the Dursleys for the next month and it was totes not chillax. Good thang was that Dudley was now so baka'ed by Harry that he social distanced from him like it was 2020 all over again, while his aunt and uncle ghosted him and pretended he didn't exist. It was cool for a bit, but soon it was a major bummer what with everyone acting like he was canceled.

Harry thankfully had his new owl to keep him vibin'. He decided to call her Hedwig cuz that was a cool sounding name he thought that he fished out of a book, which speaking of, were totes interesting which was unusual because they were school books, but whatevs. Channeling lofi energy he stayed up late, but instead of Fortnite he simply read, and sometimes Hedwig would bring him a dead mouse, the furry kind.

On August 30 Harry realised that he had no way to haul his ass to Kings Cross. Normally talking to someone in person was hard enough, to say nothing of when it was Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, but it was that or walking which was gross, so he went downstairs to where the Dursleys had plopped their asses.

"Ahem-" said Harry.

"AAAAAAH." screamed Dudley, and bailed from the room like a scrub exiting crypto.

Uncle Vernon grunted like a piggu.

"I needz ta go to Kings Cross tmr. Can I catch a ride?"

Uncle Vernon grunted like a piggu again. "I'm not an Uber, bozo. Dafuq you wizards be using a train anyway? Yous carpets all got holes?"

"You ask me I ask tree."

"Well do you at least know where the school be at?"

"Tru dat, I'll check." Harry took the note from his pocket. "It just says I need to be at Platform nine and three quarters at eleven o clock."

"What?"

"Platform nine and three quarters."

"Mouth breathers, they all are." Vernon said. "Only got one brain cell to share between all of them. But whateves, idgaf. Tmr I'm gotta be at London anyway, so thats why I'm even agreeing to this shizz."

"Why's you going to London?" asked Harry.

"Because we need to remove that phat pig tail from Dudley, you big dingus!"

The next day Harry got up at the asscrack of dawn because he was too hyped up to sleep. Howevs he didn't want to go too craycray yet so instead of putting on his robe and wizard hat he just put on your normal clothes. He paced for two hours until the others finally got out of slumberland, checked that he had everything and that Hedwig was safely in her cage, then hauled his big heavy suitcase into the Dursleys car, then the four of them set off careening to London and violating the ULEZ for good measure ðŸ˜Ž.

They reached King's Cross at 10:30 and Uncle Vernon hauled the suitcase onto a trolley. He even pushed it into the station for Harry, which Harry thought was kinda OOC but then Vernon stopped and gestured with a smug face.

"There's platform 9, and there's platform 10. You see platform 9 3/4 anywhere?"
